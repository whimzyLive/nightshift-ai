## NA-4 — per-channel ownership picker (`plugins/gtm`)

- `plugins/gtm/refs/*.md` protocol refs are thin and delegate fully to the `postiz` CLI — never
  hand-roll HTTP. New refs (e.g. `channel-config.md`) should mirror `postiz-verify.md` /
  `product-detect.md`: an intro line naming which `/gtm:init` step applies them, then concrete
  sections (no TBDs), ending in an error-handling table the calling command step can defer to
  instead of re-specifying inline.
- `marketing-context-template.md` deliberately keeps its own `<...>` placeholder tokens throughout
  (e.g. `<name>`, `<one-liner>`) as a *documented convention* for "value inserted at write time" —
  when grepping for stray placeholders across gtm refs/commands, these pre-existing tokens (and
  prose that mentions `` `<...>` `` descriptively) are expected noise, not drift. Only flag a
  genuinely new/unintended `<...>` token introduced by an edit.
- When a command step (e.g. `/gtm:init` Step 4b) is written to *defer* to a ref for enum/error
  detail rather than restate it, don't expect a verification grep for that enum text to also match
  in the command file — that's by design (single source of truth lives in the ref), not
  inconsistency.
- Multi-file plans in this plugin (ref + template + command) hinge on keeping enum lists, defaults,
  and table column order byte-identical across all three files — do the verification greps
  (Task 4-style) as the last step even when confident; cheap and catches transcription drift early.

## NA-4 review-fix follow-up

- `marketing-context-template.md`'s `## Template` fence is *rendered verbatim* into every generated
  `.claude/project/marketing-context.md` — never put writer-facing meta-instructions (empty-list
  exception prose, enum catalogues, anything with an `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-style unresolvable
  reference) inside that fence. Only actual template markup belongs there; explanatory prose about
  the template goes below the closing fence, near `## Schema` or folded into the matching
  `## Fill rules` entry — don't duplicate the same rule in two places, extend the existing Fill
  rule instead.
- When a Step-6-style summary line lists "this unblocks story X, Y, Z" and the very story this run
  implements is itself one of X/Y/Z, drop it from the unblocked-list and say its config now exists
  — a blanket "none of their config exists yet" claim placed after a per-run "N configured" line is
  self-contradicting and a reviewer will catch it.
