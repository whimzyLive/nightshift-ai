## 2026-07-10 — Story NA-16 — interactive 3D hero landing page

**Learnings:**

- `apps/marketing` is still the unmodified Nx/Next.js starter scaffold (NX
  logo, generic feature cards, no nightshift branding) — a separate GTM
  effort (`feat/gtm-site-refine-sections`, per prior memory/observations) is
  doing the full site rebuild. Stories scoped to a single section (like
  NA-16's hero) should touch only that section and leave the rest of the
  starter page alone rather than trying to "fix" the mismatch.
- Payload global content (`payload.findGlobal`) returns each field's
  `defaultValue` even before any document row exists in the DB — this is
  the correct way to satisfy "renders without manual CMS entry" without a
  seed script.
- `pnpm exec payload generate:types` (run from `apps/marketing`) needs a
  _reachable_ Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`) to instantiate Payload, but does
  **not** need the actual tables/schema to exist — it only reads the config.
  Use `pnpm nx run @nightshift-ai/marketing:local-start` /
  `:local-stop` (docker compose) to get a throwaway DB for this.
- The docker-compose project/container names in `apps/marketing/docker-compose.yml`
  are fixed (`nightshift_postgres` etc, not worktree/branch-scoped) — running
  `local-start` from one worktree will recreate/collide with containers from
  any other worktree using the same compose file. Stop it again when done
  (`local-stop`) so you don't strand a container.
- Git worktree gotcha: `cd` inside a Bash call to the _shared_ checkout path
  (`nightshift/...` without the `.claude/worktrees/<agent-id>/` prefix) will
  silently operate on the wrong git checkout — `git checkout <branch>` there
  can steal a branch out from under another worktree ("branch already used
  by worktree" on retry). Read/Write/Edit tools correctly refuse this, but
  Bash does not. Always prefix paths with the worktree root for every tool.
- A fresh git worktree has no `node_modules` — `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  from the worktree root reuses the shared pnpm store and is fast (~a few
  seconds), no network fetch needed if the store is already warm.

**Pitfalls:**

- Adding a Payload `findGlobal`/`find` call directly in a Next.js App Router
  page makes that route attempt static prerendering at `next build` time by
  default — which then requires a **migrated** Postgres schema to exist
  (not just a reachable DB.) A brand-new global with no migration yet fails
  build with `relation "<slug>" does not exist`. Fix: add
  `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to the page so Payload is only
  queried at request time — this is also the _more correct_ choice for
  CMS content that must reflect admin edits without a redeploy. Don't try
  to fight the DB-at-build-time requirement (e.g. by faking data) if you
  can instead just defer rendering — check first whether the page even
  needs to be statically prerendered.
- Testing an async Server Component with Jest + `@testing-library/react`
  does **not** work by nesting it as JSX (`<Page />`) inside another
  render — React's client renderer errors because the component returns a
  Promise. The working pattern: call the async component function yourself
  and hand the resolved element tree to `render()`, e.g.
  `render(await Page())`. Keep the async work at a single top-level
  boundary (the page itself) rather than nesting a second async component
  inside it, or this pattern doesn't compose.
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` (`toBeInTheDocument`, `toHaveAttribute`, etc.)
  is **not** installed in this workspace — the existing test setup only
  gives you the base Jest matchers. Use `.toBeTruthy()` /
  `.getAttribute(...)` comparisons instead, don't add the dependency for a
  single story without an explicit instruction (touches the lockfile).
- GSAP type predicate gotcha: narrowing an array of `HTMLXRef.current`
  values (different concrete HTML element types) to a single named DOM type
  (e.g. `el is HTMLElement`) fails `next build`'s TypeScript pass
  ("type predicate's type must be assignable to its parameter's type") when
  the union includes a type not assignable _from_ that name (e.g.
  `HTMLAnchorElement` isn't narrowed _to_ by declaring `HTMLElement`, even
  though it's a supertype). Use `el is NonNullable<typeof el>` instead of
  naming a concrete type.
- GSAP's transform aliases are `rotationX`/`rotationY` (not `rotateX`/
  `rotateY`) — passing the CSS-style names to `gsap.quickTo`/`gsap.to`
  silently does nothing.

**Patterns:**

- Hero-local brand tokens: rather than importing the nightshift-design
  skill's `styles.css` (meant for static mock/prototype output, not a
  production app bundle) or editing the site-wide `global.css` for a
  single-section story, declare the exact hex values as CSS custom
  properties scoped to the component's own root class in its CSS module,
  with a comment noting they mirror `.claude/skills/nightshift-design/tokens/*.css`.
  Keeps brand-on-the-hero without leaking a site-wide theme change that's
  out of scope.
- Layered CSS 3D parallax without a 3D library: `perspective` on a static
  wrapper, `transform-style: preserve-3d` on an inner "scene" div that GSAP
  rotates (`rotationX`/`rotationY` via `gsap.quickTo`, driven by
  `pointermove`), and each visual layer inside it at a different
  `translateZ`. Avoids the three.js/`@react-three/fiber` bundle cost for a
  hero-only decorative effect — reasonable when the story explicitly allows
  choosing the lighter implementation.
- `gsap.matchMedia({ reduceMotion: '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)' }, ...)`
  is the single place to branch: skip the entrance timeline, skip the
  pointermove listener, skip the ScrollTrigger creation, and `gsap.set(...)`
  straight to the final visible state when `reduceMotion` is true. Testable
  by mocking `gsap.matchMedia`'s `add(query, handler)` to capture the
  handler and invoking it directly with both `{ reduceMotion: true }` and
  `{ reduceMotion: false }`, then asserting which GSAP calls fired.
