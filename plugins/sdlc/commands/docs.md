description: Generate and maintain this repo's public docs surface via the doc-type registry and per-repo docs manifest. Ships five live modes — `sync` diff-drives deterministic reference-doc + `llms.txt` regen and drafts gated how-to refreshes; `release <version>` aggregates merged stories since the last tag into changelog/release-notes/migration-guide; `seed <type> [topic]` scaffolds one new narrative page for founder authoring at the confirm gate (`seed adr "<pattern>"` routes to the ADR pipeline instead); `audit [--dry-run]` scans activated rows for drift, auto-corrects via PR, flags narrative drift; `distill ["<focus>"]` mines the learnings corpus for promotable ADR candidates via refs/adr-pipeline.md. All modes regenerate the doc index + `llms.txt` where applicable, run behind the knowledge-engineer agent, with the founder-confirmation gate at this command layer.

## Modes (dispatched from `$ARGUMENTS`)

| Invocation                       | Mode        | v1 status           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| `/sdlc:docs sync <STORY-KEY>`    | **sync**    | Shipped (NA-52)     |
| `/sdlc:docs release <version>`   | **release** | Shipped (NA-53)     |
| `/sdlc:docs seed <type> [topic]` | **seed**    | **Shipped (NA-54)** |
| `/sdlc:docs audit [--dry-run]`   | **audit**   | **Shipped (NA-55)** |
| `/sdlc:docs distill ["<focus>"]` | **distill** | **Shipped (NA-57)** |

## Argument validation

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into `<mode>` (the first token) and the mode's remaining args. Apply, in order:

1. **Empty `$ARGUMENTS`** → STOP with the usage message:
   `usage: /sdlc:docs sync <STORY-KEY> | release <version> | seed <type> [topic] | seed adr "<pattern>" | audit [--dry-run] | distill ["<focus>"]`.
2. **Unrecognised first token** (not one of `sync`/`release`/`seed`/`audit`/`distill`) → STOP with
   the same usage message.
3. **`sync` with a missing or malformed story key** — the story key must match
   `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-[0-9]+$` (e.g. `NA-52`). If the key is absent or fails the regex → STOP with the
   usage message. This is a **usage STOP** (a caller error), distinct from the manifest-absent
   silent no-op below.
4. **`release` with a missing or empty `<version>`** → STOP with the usage message. A **usage STOP**,
   distinct from the manifest-absent silent no-op and the no-stories-merged clean no-op.
5. **`release` `<version>` — hard-validate, then normalise.** `<version>` is **not** free text: it
   becomes a git branch name (`docs/release-<VERSION>`), page ids (`docs/release-notes/<VERSION>.md`,
   `docs/migration-guides/<VERSION>.md`), and the `## <VERSION>` changelog heading the upsert keys
   on. It is validated exactly as step 3 hard-validates `sync`'s story key **because** it forms a
   branch/ref — same discipline, different regex:

   ```text
   raw token must match:  ^[vV]?[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z.]*(-[0-9A-Za-z.]+)*-?$
   normalise:             strip a single leading "v" or "V"  →  VERSION
   VERSION must additionally satisfy, or the run STOPs:
     - non-empty
     - contains no ".."
     - does not end in "." or "-"
     - does not end in ".lock"
   ```

   **The trailing `-?` is deliberate, not a stray permissiveness.** Without that trailing `-?`, a
   token ending in a bare `-` (e.g. `1.4-`) fails the regex **outright** — the `(-[0-9A-Za-z.]+)*`
   group requires at least one character after every `-`, so a trailing `-` has nothing to consume
   and the whole match fails — meaning it never reaches the "ends in '-'" check below and instead
   surfaces the generic "fails the token regex" message, which is **inaccurate** for this input
   (`1.4-` genuinely is only letters, digits, and `-`). Verified **against that superseded,
   `-?`-less regex**: `1.4-` was rejected outright, while `1.4.` and `1..4` passed it and reached
   their specific checks. The trailing `-?` lets a bare trailing dash pass the character-class check
   so it is caught by the **specific** "ends in '-'" STOP instead — the same fix shape as the
   `.lock` case below (widen the regex so the specific rule, not the generic one, catches it). It
   does not loosen anything else: `1--2` (an interior double-dash) still fails, because the repeated
   group still requires ≥1 character after each non-trailing `-`.

   Each failure is a **usage STOP** raised **before** any branch, dispatch, draft, or founder gate —
   a caller passing `release ../../oops` is rejected at the ladder, never after the founder has
   confirmed drafts. Each STOP states **its own** rejection reason (a single generic message would
   misdescribe `1.4.lock`, which _does_ satisfy "letters, digits, '.', '-'"):

   ```text
   fails the token regex   → invalid version "<raw>" — expected a token like 1.4.0 or v1.4.0
                             (letters, digits, ".", "-"; no path separators or whitespace)
   contains ".."           → invalid version "<raw>" — must not contain ".." (git refuses the
                             branch ref docs/release-<VERSION>)
   ends in "."              → invalid version "<raw>" — must not end in "." (git refuses the
                             branch ref docs/release-<VERSION> — verified:
                             `git check-ref-format --branch docs/release-1.4.` → invalid)
   ends in "-"              → invalid version "<raw>" — must not end in "-" (not a git ref-format
                             violation — `docs/release-1.4-` is a valid ref; the real reason is
                             token hygiene: "-" conventionally introduces a pre-release suffix, as
                             in 1.4.0-RC1, and a bare trailing "-" leaves that suffix empty)
   ends in ".lock"         → invalid version "<raw>" — must not end in ".lock" (git refuses the
                             branch ref docs/release-<VERSION>)
   empty after normalising → invalid version "<raw>" — version is empty after stripping the
                             leading "v" or "V"
   ```

   - **The `.` and `-` STOPs share one validation rule but have different true reasons — do not
     conflate them.** A trailing `.` genuinely is a git ref-format violation (verified above); a
     trailing `-` is not (also verified above) — its rejection is deliberate token hygiene, not a
     git constraint. Stating "git refuses" for both, as an earlier version of this text did, is
     false for the `-` half.
   - **The `.lock` rule is `VERSION.endswith(".lock")` — NOT a per-dot-component test.** Git's
     `.lock` prohibition applies to **slash**-separated ref components. The branch is
     `docs/release-<VERSION>`, whose last slash-component is `release-<VERSION>` — that component
     ends in `.lock` **iff `VERSION` does**. A per-**dot** component test would be **vacuous**:
     `1.4.lock` splits on `.` into `1`, `4`, `lock`, none of which _ends in_ `.lock` (they contain no
     dots), so such a rule rejects nothing and `1.4.lock` would reach `git checkout` and fail there —
     after the founder had confirmed drafts. Verified:
     `git check-ref-format --branch docs/release-1.4.lock` → `fatal: not a valid branch name`.
   - **Normalisation is identity-forming, not cosmetic.** `1.4.0`, `v1.4.0`, and `V1.4.0` all
     normalise to the **same** `VERSION` and therefore the same branch, PR, changelog section, and
     pages. The strip is **case-insensitive on this one leading character only** (`v` or `V`) —
     without it, `V1.4.0` would keep its `V` (the token regex's general `[0-9A-Za-z]` class accepts
     an uppercase `V` as an ordinary body character, same as any other alnum, so it is never rejected;
     only the strip step decides whether it is treated as the marker), forking a **second** branch
     (`docs/release-V1.4.0` alongside `docs/release-1.4.0`), a second open PR for the same version
     (the re-run dedupe keys on branch name, and these are two different names), a duplicate
     `## V1.4.0` changelog section, and duplicate release-notes/migration-guide pages — precisely the
     outcome this bullet exists to prevent.
   - **`VERSION` (normalised), not the raw token, is used everywhere downstream** — branch, PR title,
     commit string, page ids, changelog heading, no-op notices. The raw token is echoed **only** in
     the STOP messages above.
   - **Case is significant and deliberately not folded — but only past the single leading marker
     character.** The leading-`v`/`V` strip above is the **one** case-insensitive step; everything
     after it keeps its case exactly as typed. `1.4.0-RC1` and `1.4.0-rc1` are distinct `VERSION`s →
     distinct branches and page ids, which **collide** on a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS
     default). Folding the rest of the token would break legitimately case-distinct labels; v1
     accepts that collision while still closing the `V1.4.0`/`v1.4.0` split above — the two rules
     are not in tension: one governs the optional single-character prefix marker, the other governs
     the version body after it.
   - Beyond token safety, `<VERSION>` is **not** hard-validated against semver — a date-based label
     (e.g. `2026.07.1`) passes.

6. **`seed` with a missing `<type>`** → STOP with the usage message **plus** the valid type list. A
   **usage STOP** (caller error), distinct from the manifest-absent silent no-op below.
7. **`seed` `<type>` = `adr`** — the **special ADR route** (branches before the generic seed gates;
   `adr` never enters `SEED_TYPES`). **Empty-pattern STOP (relocated command-layer guard):** if the
   pattern text after `adr` is empty (`/sdlc:docs seed adr` or `/sdlc:docs seed adr ""`) → **STOP**
   with a usage message (`usage: /sdlc:docs seed adr "<pattern>"`), **before** dispatching Phase 1 —
   never draft an ADR from empty input. This guards `seed adr`'s pattern only. Otherwise dispatch
   the **ADR pipeline (seed)** at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/adr-pipeline.md` with an explicit
   **ADR dispatch-type signal** (there is no longer a command name to infer it from): **no**
   manifest gate, **no** type-activation gate — the `docs/adr/` target resolves from
   `project-context.md` exactly as the retained pipeline does. The two-phase split, the
   founder-confirm gate at this command layer, and the `docs(adr):` branch/PR naming are handed to
   the agent per `refs/adr-pipeline.md`'s §3a command-layer-flow section, not restated here.
8. **`seed` `<type>` not in `SEED_TYPES` ∪ `{adr}`** → usage STOP naming what was passed and
   enumerating the valid set:

   ```text
   unknown seed type "<type>" — valid types: <comma-separated resolved SEED_TYPES>
   (derived from the seed-triggered rows of refs/doc-types.md)
   for ADRs, use seed adr "<pattern>" instead
   ```

   `SEED_TYPES` is resolved **at read time** from `refs/doc-types.md`'s `trigger` cells, minus `adr`
   — see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` §15. The enumerated list in this message is
   **rendered from the resolved `SEED_TYPES`**, never typed as a literal — otherwise it becomes the
   hardcoded copy the derivation rule exists to avoid. **This file is `command-reference`
   source-of-truth, published verbatim by `sync`** (`refs/doc-types.md`'s `command-reference` row),
   so the placeholder above is deliberate, not merely illustrative — a literal value here would ship
   stale reference copy the moment a registry `trigger` cell changes. As of this writing that
   placeholder resolves to `concept, tutorial, integration-guide, how-to` (shown for the reader's
   convenience only; never copy this list back into the template above).

9. **`seed` `<topic>`, when supplied, is validated and normalised here — at the ladder, before any
   gate.** The slugify rule and its **three** reachable STOPs (empty / >80 chars / reserved page id)
   are defined once in `refs/docs-pipeline.md` §15 and are **not** restated here. This placement is
   the direct lesson from NA-53, where a version token that forms a branch name reached the gate
   unvalidated. **`<topic>` omitted is NOT an error** (the signature is `[topic]`) — the command
   prompts for it, but **after** the manifest and type-activation gates, so a repo with nothing to
   do is never prompted first. **A prompted topic runs the identical ladder** (§15): validation the
   primary input path never reaches is not validation.
10. **`audit` flag recognition — the entire `audit` validation surface.** `audit` takes no free-text
    argument (nothing forming a branch, path, or ref), so NA-53's `<version>` ladder and NA-54's
    `<topic>` slug ladder have **no analogue here** — do not import one.
    1. **`audit` with no further tokens** → default (PR) mode. Not an error.
    2. **`audit --dry-run`** (the flag is the sole remaining token) → dry-run (report-only) mode.
    3. **`audit <anything-else>`** — any remaining token not exactly `--dry-run` (e.g. `--dryrun`,
       `foo`, `--dry-run extra`) → **usage STOP**:

       ```text
       unknown argument for audit — usage: /sdlc:docs audit [--dry-run]
       ```

       A usage STOP (caller error), **distinct from the manifest-absent silent no-op** — a founder
       who fat-fingers `--dryrun` must not get a live PR-opening run they thought was a dry run.

## `sync <STORY-KEY>` — shared pipeline split across the dispatch boundary

The procedure — the two-phase dispatch split, the deterministic regen algorithm, the voice/format
resolution chain, the `source:` refresh convention, and the no-op/change-gate semantics — is
defined once in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md`; this command owns only the flow
around the founder-confirmation gate (a dispatched subagent cannot itself pause for it), the
argument validation above, and the gates below that decide whether `knowledge-engineer` is
dispatched at all.

1. **Manifest gate (AC5).** Shared with `release` — defined **once** in
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#manifest-gate-shared-by-sync-release-seed-and-audit` (the
   base-ref resolution pre-check that runs **before** the manifest read — an unresolvable
   `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` is a STOP, never mistaken for "manifest absent" — then the
   checkout-independent `git show`, then the silent no-op on genuine absence). This command does not
   re-derive it; the gate's `git fetch origin --quiet` also covers step 2 below, so that step does
   not fetch again.

2. **Resolve the story branch (v1 diff source).** `sync` never depends on the currently-checked-out
   branch. The Manifest gate above already fetched `origin`, so this step does not fetch again:

   ```bash
   # Resolve the story branch: feat/<STORY-KEY> preferred, fix/<STORY-KEY> fallback.
   STORY_BRANCH=""
   for cand in "feat/<STORY-KEY>" "fix/<STORY-KEY>"; do
     git rev-parse --verify --quiet "origin/$cand" >/dev/null && { STORY_BRANCH="origin/$cand"; break; }
   done
   ```

   - **Neither `origin/feat/<STORY-KEY>` nor `origin/fix/<STORY-KEY>` exists** → select the
     **merged-commit** diff source per
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#26-dual-diff-source--selection-rule`: locate the
     commit(s) on `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` carrying `<STORY-KEY>` (the `PROJECT_KEYS`-scoped regex from
     §10 — never the loose matcher) and set `CHANGED_FILES` / `CHANGED_DIFF` from the merged range
     (`<sha>^..<sha>`, or the union across matches). **Zero commits carry the key** → STOP with
     `cannot locate a merged commit for <STORY-KEY> on origin/<BASE-BRANCH> — nothing to diff`
     (never a silent no-op). `git fetch` failure / unresolvable `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` → STOP.
     `STORY_BRANCH` stays empty; set `REGEN_TREE_REF=origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`
     (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#2-two-phase-dispatch-split-across-the-confirmation-boundary`
     step 2 — base HEAD already contains the landed commit(s), so it is the tree the regen reads
     from and the tree Phase 2 checks out from).

3. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` Phase 1 (compute & draft, writes nothing).**
   - **`STORY_BRANCH` resolved** (the common case) → pass `STORY_BRANCH`, `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`
     (the **remote-tracking** base ref from project-context, not the bare local branch name — a
     stale local checkout must never skew the diff), and the story key. Per
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` §2 step 3, phase 1 **computes**
     `CHANGED_FILES`/`CHANGED_DIFF` from `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>...$STORY_BRANCH` itself;
     `REGEN_TREE_REF=$STORY_BRANCH` (§2 step 2).
   - **`STORY_BRANCH` empty — merged-commit path selected** (previous step) → pass the
     **precomputed** `CHANGED_FILES`/`CHANGED_DIFF` (already derived from the merged range above)
     and `REGEN_TREE_REF=origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` instead. Per
     `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` §2 step 3, phase 1 uses these **verbatim** — it
     does **not** recompute from `$STORY_BRANCH` (there is none to diff against). This is the fix
     that makes the merged-commit path actually regenerate — a bare `STORY_BRANCH`-only dispatch
     here would diff against nothing and silently no-op.
   - In both shapes, phase 1 resolves affected rows, produces the deterministic regen content for
     the `auto` rows + `llms.txt` (reading source content from `REGEN_TREE_REF`, §2 step 5), drafts
     narrative how-to refreshes via `writing-docs`, and returns all of it to this command layer.

4. **Founder-confirmation gate (command layer, in-session, between the two dispatches):**
   - Present the deterministic regen summary (informational — auto rows are not gated; they were
     already computed, not yet written) and each narrative how-to draft (gated). Wait for explicit
     founder confirmation on the narrative drafts — identical discipline to `/sdlc:analyze`'s apply
     gate and the `seed adr`/`distill` routes' founder-confirmation gate below: no inline auto-apply
     path.
   - The founder may accept, edit, or reject each narrative draft.
   - **The gate is skipped when there are zero narrative drafts** — proceed straight to phase 2
     with the deterministic content only.

5. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` Phase 2 (write confirmed, fresh dispatch).** Hand it the
   deterministic content **and** the founder-confirmed narrative drafts **verbatim** (inline or via
   session temp-dir files referenced by path, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tmp-dir.sh`) —
   never re-derived. Phase 2 checks out the branch (see Branch/PR naming below, cut from
   `REGEN_TREE_REF` — the story branch head when present, or `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` on the
   merged-commit path; never a bare local `<BASE-BRANCH>`), writes the deterministic regen +
   `llms.txt` + confirmed narrative drafts under their manifest-resolved `target-path`s, then —
   **only if content changed** (`git status --porcelain` on the written target paths is non-empty,
   AC6) — commits via `conventional-commit`, pushes, and opens or updates the sync PR.

6. **Write + PR only on change (AC6).** If, after writing, `git status --porcelain` on the target
   paths is **empty** (deterministic output was byte-identical and no narrative draft was
   confirmed) → no commit, no PR, exit cleanly. Otherwise commit and **open or update** the sync PR
   (see Branch/PR naming).

## `release <version>` — shared pipeline split across the dispatch boundary

The release run mirrors `sync`'s two-phase dispatch and command-layer founder-confirm gate. The
shared skeleton lives in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` §2, and the release-specific
procedure — enumeration, aggregation, upsert, ADR-link resolution, branch/PR control flow, no-op
semantics — is defined once in that ref's **§§10–14**. This command owns only the gates below, the
argument validation above, and the founder-confirm gate between the two dispatches.

1. **Manifest gate (AC6).** Shared with `sync` — same pointer, same mechanics: see step 1 of the
   `sync` procedure above,
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#manifest-gate-shared-by-sync-release-seed-and-audit`. The
   base-ref resolution pre-check runs first (an unresolvable `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` STOPs — it is
   never mistaken for "manifest absent"), then the checkout-independent `git show`, then the silent
   no-op on genuine absence. Do not dispatch `knowledge-engineer` on either exit path.

2. **Enabled-row gate — resolve `ENABLED_ROWS` once, then thread it everywhere.** From the manifest,
   resolve which of the three `release`-triggered registry rows (`changelog`, `release-notes`,
   `migration-guide`) are **enabled**; call that subset `ENABLED_ROWS`.
   - **Absent is never default-on.** A row **present** in the manifest row-table is enabled per its
     `enabled` column (the template's Fill rules default it to `true` for every _written_ row). A row
     **absent** from the table is **not** enabled. Absence has two causes and the distinction does not
     matter here: the type was offered and declined (a `<!-- declined: <type> -->` comment), or the
     row was deleted (which a future re-init may re-offer — `/init`'s business, not `release`'s).
     **Never infer a missing row as enabled.**
   - **`ENABLED_ROWS` empty** → **clean no-op**: print
     `no release-triggered doc types enabled in docs-manifest.md — nothing to generate` and exit
     without a PR. Informational, not silent — the manifest exists, so the founder opted in.
   - **`ENABLED_ROWS` is a per-row filter, not a one-time collective gate.** It is an explicit input
     to phase 1, to the gate, and to phase 2, and each **must re-consult it per row**: phase 1 drafts
     **only** enabled rows' artifacts, the gate presents **only** those drafts, phase 2 writes
     **only** those pages. This is the release instance of the §2 step 4 / §3 invariant that
     regeneration "never touches an unaffected row's pages". A founder who disables `release-notes` or
     `migration-guide` must never have those pages drafted, shown, or created. `ENABLED_ROWS =
{changelog}` produces exactly one artifact, one gate item, one written page.

3. **Resolve the last tag and the merged-story set.** Per `refs/docs-pipeline.md` §10 — the base-ref
   pre-check, the **positive shallow-clone pre-check**, the `No names found`-only fallthrough, the
   **single-ended** no-tags range, the RS/US delimited `git log` format and its parse rules, and the
   story-key regex scoped to the `PROJECT_KEYS` set (primary key + manifest-configured additional
   keys). Every git failure is a **STOP**, never a silent fallthrough. **No stories merged** → clean
   no-op with §14's two notice wordings (never an empty interpolation).

   **Compute the out-of-scope key warning (AC3) — only when `PROJECT_KEYS ≠ ∅`.** Over the same
   `(subject, body)` records §10 enumerated (no second scan), compute `OUT_OF_SCOPE` and its
   `LIKELY_KEYS` / `STANDARDS_MATCHES` partition per
   `refs/docs-pipeline.md` §10's `### Out-of-scope key warning`. When `PROJECT_KEYS = ∅` (State A),
   **skip this entirely** — nothing is out-of-scope; never route `∅` into a suppressing no-op. **The
   warning fires iff `LIKELY_KEYS ≠ ∅` — never merely `OUT_OF_SCOPE ≠ ∅`.** `OUT_OF_SCOPE` also
   contains `STANDARDS_MATCHES`, and a range whose only out-of-scope tokens are standards-prefixed
   (e.g. bodies citing `RFC-2119`/`SHA-256`, zero genuine unrecognised keys) has `LIKELY_KEYS = ∅`
   even though `OUT_OF_SCOPE ≠ ∅` — that range must **not** fire the warning (it would render an
   empty individual-key list under an active header and a "register this as a project" footer,
   driven by demoted standards noise alone — the exact inversion AC4 exists to prevent). The warning
   is **advisory** (never blocks) and prints at whichever exit the run reaches:
   - **No-op split (§14).** If the emitted (`IN_SCOPE`) set is empty:
     - `PROJECT_KEYS = ∅`, **or** `LIKELY_KEYS = ∅` (including the standards-only case, whether or
       not `STANDARDS_MATCHES ≠ ∅`) → the existing clean no-op (§14's two `LAST_TAG` wordings). No
       warning.
     - `PROJECT_KEYS ≠ ∅` **and** `LIKELY_KEYS ≠ ∅` → **the warning no-op** (the pure silent-drop
       case — at least one genuine unrecognised key): print the warning below, then exit 0 with
       **no PR**. The message must **not** claim unqualified "nothing to release". These two
       branches are keyed on the single variable `LIKELY_KEYS` (empty vs. non-empty), so they are
       **mutually exclusive** — no range matches both, and no legacy-key range can be silently
       swallowed by the clean branch.
   - **Gate path.** If the emitted set is non-empty and `LIKELY_KEYS ≠ ∅`, carry `OUT_OF_SCOPE` (and
     its `LIKELY_KEYS`/`STANDARDS_MATCHES` partition) to the founder-confirm gate (step 5). If
     `LIKELY_KEYS = ∅` (including the standards-only case), the gate proceeds normally with **no**
     warning line, even if `STANDARDS_MATCHES ≠ ∅`.

The warning text is built from **live state**, never hardcoded. **The entire block below — header,
count, colon, individual list, standards-demotion line, and remediation footer — renders as one
unit, gated on `LIKELY_KEYS ≠ ∅`; none of these pieces ever appears alone:**

```text
WARNING: <N> Jira-key-shaped token(s) in this range are outside PROJECT_KEYS, so they are dropped
from this release and will NOT appear in <human-named ENABLED_ROWS>:
  - <LIKELY_KEY> — <its most-recent subject>
  … (one line per LIKELY_KEYS token)
(<M> token(s) matched common-standards prefixes (<distinct folded prefixes, e.g. RFC, SHA>) and were not listed individually — if any names a real Jira project, add its prefix as above.)
To include them, <section-aware remediation>, then re-run `release <version>`.
```

- **`N = |OUT_OF_SCOPE| = |LIKELY_KEYS| + |STANDARDS_MATCHES|`** (the total dropped-token count named
  in the header) and **`M = |STANDARDS_MATCHES|`** (the demoted-only count in the parenthetical) are
  **distinct variables — never the same letter, never interchanged.** The individual list under the
  header shows one line per `LIKELY_KEYS` token only; `STANDARDS_MATCHES` tokens never get their own
  line, only the aggregated `M`-count line.
- **Name the actually-enabled release rows, not "the changelog".** Map `changelog → "the changelog"`,
  `release-notes → "the release notes"`, `migration-guide → "the migration guide"`, listing **only**
  those in `ENABLED_ROWS` this run. (`ENABLED_ROWS` is resolved at step 2, so it is known on both the
  no-op path and the gate path.)
- **The `STANDARDS_MATCHES` line is emitted only when `STANDARDS_MATCHES ≠ ∅`, and only as an
  addendum inside an already-firing warning** (`LIKELY_KEYS ≠ ∅`) — it is never, by itself, what
  fires the warning (see the `LIKELY_KEYS ≠ ∅` trigger above). Its parenthesised prefix list is the
  **distinct prefixes actually folded this run** — never fixed text, never a bare count.
- **Section-aware remediation** — check whether `.claude/project/docs-manifest.md` already contains an
  `## Additional Jira project keys` heading:
  - **present** → "add the prefix(es) to the existing `## Additional Jira project keys` section".
  - **absent** (an upgraded repo that never re-ran init) → "add an `## Additional Jira project keys`
    section (a comma-separated key list — see `refs/docs-manifest-template.md`)". Never tell a founder
    to edit a section that isn't there.

4. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` Phase 1 (compute & draft, writes nothing).** Pass it `VERSION`,
   `ENABLED_ROWS`, the resolved commit range, the merged-story key set (each key with its
   `(subject, body)` records), and `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`. Phase 1 drafts **only the artifacts whose
   row is in `ENABLED_ROWS`** — the changelog entry (§11), the ADR-linked release notes (§12), and/or
   the headings-only migration stub (§12) — and returns the drafts **it actually produced** (plus the
   resolved merged-story set and ADR-link map), each **labelled with its row** so the gate and phase 2
   filter on the same subset. **Nothing is written to disk in phase 1.**

5. **Founder-confirmation gate (command layer, between the two dispatches).** Present **every
   release-artifact draft phase 1 returned — and only those** (the `ENABLED_ROWS` subset, never a
   fixed set of three) and wait for explicit founder confirmation. The founder may accept, edit, or
   reject each. An enabled changelog draft rides the **same** gate because its registry
   `generation-mode` is `draft-for-review` — the registry marks all three `draft-for-review`, and
   nothing is written un-confirmed. If `ENABLED_ROWS` resolved to a single row, the gate presents a
   single draft. **This gate is the only place release content is edited** (§13's "Where edits live").
   `gh` MAY enrich what is **displayed** here (e.g. PR titles alongside keys); it MUST NOT feed any
   byte written to a file (§11's `gh` boundary).

   If step 3 carried a non-empty `LIKELY_KEYS` to this gate (`PROJECT_KEYS ≠ ∅`, the emitted set was
   non-empty, and at least one genuine unrecognised key exists — never merely `STANDARDS_MATCHES ≠
∅`), print the step-3 out-of-scope key warning **alongside the drafts, before the founder
   confirms** — same text, same `ENABLED_ROWS`-named rows and section-aware remediation. It is
   **advisory only: it never blocks** the release and never mutates the manifest.

6. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` Phase 2 (write confirmed, fresh dispatch).** Hand it `VERSION`,
   `ENABLED_ROWS`, and the founder-confirmed drafts **verbatim** (inline or via
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tmp-dir.sh` temp files by path) — never re-derived. Phase 2 checks
   out the release branch per §13 (fresh from `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` head on a first run; the
   **existing** branch **at its remote head** on a re-run, after §13's precondition + both guards
   pass), writes the confirmed content **for `ENABLED_ROWS` only** under their manifest-resolved
   `target-path`s, applies §11's changelog upsert, deterministically regenerates the doc index +
   `llms.txt` (§14), and — **only if `git status --porcelain` on the written paths is non-empty** —
   commits via `conventional-commit` with the `Release-Generated: <VERSION>` trailer, pushes, and
   opens or updates the release PR.

## `seed <type> [topic]` — shared pipeline split across the dispatch boundary

The seed run mirrors `sync`/`release`'s two-phase dispatch and command-layer founder-confirm gate.
The shared skeleton lives in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` §2, and the seed-specific
procedure — type resolution, the topic/slug ladder, `PAGE` construction, the gate ladder, page
artifacts, branch/PR control flow, no-op and re-run semantics — is defined once in that ref's
**§§15–19**. This command owns only the gates below, the argument validation above, and the
founder-confirm gate between the two dispatches.

**The ordering below is load-bearing.** Everything through step 5 runs **before the founder authors
anything**: for `seed`, a post-gate STOP does not merely waste a machine's work as it would in
`sync` or `release` — **it destroys the founder's entire page**. Every rejection whose inputs are
already available is hoisted ahead of the gate.

1. **Argument validation** — the ladder above, including a supplied `<topic>`.

2. **Manifest gate (AC5).** Shared with `sync` and `release` — defined once at
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#manifest-gate-shared-by-sync-release-seed-and-audit`
   (base-ref resolution pre-check → checkout-independent `git show` → silent no-op on genuine
   absence). **Not re-derived here**; `seed` is its third consumer. If **absent** → **silent no-op**:
   no prompt, no branch, no dispatch, no PR, no error, **no stdout**, exit 0. Do not dispatch
   `knowledge-engineer`.

3. **Type-activation gate (AC2)** — per `refs/docs-pipeline.md` §16 step 3. Resolve `SEED_ROW` from
   the manifest; the type is activated iff its row is **present** **and** `enabled = true`.
   **Absent is never activated — never infer a missing row as enabled.** Not activated → print
   `doc type "<type>" is not activated in .claude/project/docs-manifest.md — nothing seeded`
   plus `(add or enable its row to seed this type)`, and make **no write**. **Informational, not
   silent** — the manifest exists, so the founder opted in. Do not dispatch `knowledge-engineer`.
   **`target-path` comes from `SEED_ROW`, not the registry default.**

4. **Topic resolution (prompt if omitted).** Prompt here — this is the only layer that can pause for
   input — and run the **identical** §15 ladder on the answer. Placed **after** gates 2–3 so a repo
   with no manifest is never prompted before its silent no-op.

5. **Page-exists + branch-state gate — all of it pre-gate** (`refs/docs-pipeline.md` §16 step 5).
   Construct `PAGE` by **normalising the trailing slash before joining** — every registry
   `target-path` ends in `/`, so a naive join makes this gate **fail open** and phase 2 overwrite a
   published page (§16 carries the verified rationale). Check it checkout-independently at
   `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`. Exists at base → **STOP** (`seed` is a create verb). Exists only on the
   branch → a re-run: **§18's local-branch precondition and both re-run guards are evaluated HERE**,
   before phase 1 dispatches. Exists nowhere → first run — **the local-branch precondition still
   runs.**

6. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` Phase 1 (scaffold & draft, writes nothing).** Pass it `<type>`,
   `SEED_ROW` (its `target-path`), `SLUG`, the **raw** topic text, the normalised `PAGE`, and
   `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`. Phase 1 loads `writing-docs` unconditionally, scaffolds exactly one page
   from the `<type>`'s registry-quadrant template, never invents facts to fill a section, emits the
   required frontmatter, and returns the scaffold. **Nothing is written to disk in phase 1.**

7. **Founder-confirm gate (AC3) — this is where the founder authors.** Present the scaffold; the
   founder may accept, edit, author over, or reject it. **This is the mode's whole point:** unlike
   `sync`/`release`, where the gate mostly confirms machine-derived content, here the gate **is the
   authoring surface**, and heavy editing is the expected path.
   - **Validate the confirmed content HERE, at the gate, while it still exists** — specifically the
     required `title` + `description` frontmatter (`refs/docs-pipeline.md` §17). **Not deferred to
     phase 2**: phase 2 is a fresh dispatch holding an opaque payload, so a check there can only STOP
     — it cannot ask the founder to fix the missing line — converting a one-line correction into the
     loss of a whole authored page.
   - For a `how-to` / `integration-guide`, present the `source:` glob list: globs supplied → written
     with `source:` (future `sync` runs draft refreshes); omitted → **the key is omitted entirely**,
     never written empty, and **never inferred** (§17).
   - **Founder rejects / does not confirm** → write nothing, no branch, no PR, no phase-2 dispatch;
     report and exit cleanly. Unlike `release`, there is no deterministic half worth committing.
   - `gh` and the learnings corpus MAY enrich what is **displayed** here; neither may feed a written
     byte except through the founder's confirmation (§19).

8. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` Phase 2 (write confirmed, fresh dispatch).** Pass it `<type>`,
   `SEED_ROW`, `SLUG`, the normalised `PAGE`, and the founder-confirmed content **verbatim** (inline
   or via `scripts/tmp-dir.sh` temp files by path — **never re-derived**). Phase 2 re-verifies the
   precondition + guards as a **mandatory** TOCTOU backstop (preserving the confirmed content on a
   STOP), writes the confirmed content to `PAGE` and **only** to `PAGE`, regenerates the index +
   `llms.txt` per §19 (**`llms.txt` only if its own manifest row is present and enabled — checked
   independently of `SEED_ROW`**), and commits/pushes/opens-or-updates the PR **only if
   `git status --porcelain` on the written paths is non-empty** (AC4).

## `audit [--dry-run]` — single-dispatch drift scan + deterministic correction

Unlike `sync`/`release`/`seed`, `audit` has **no founder-confirm gate** and therefore **no two-phase
dispatch split** — its `auto`-row corrections are un-gated and its narrative findings are flags, not
writes. It collapses to a **single** `knowledge-engineer` dispatch. The full procedure is defined
once in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` **§§20–24**; this command owns only the
manifest gate, the flag ladder above, the single dispatch, and the report/PR surfacing.

```text
1. argument validation  →  2. manifest gate (§1)  →  3. dispatch knowledge-engineer (audit)
→  4. scan + compute (§§20–22)  →  5a. --dry-run: report, no PR (§23)
                                    5b. default: write corrections + PR-on-change (§24)
```

1. **Argument validation** — the flag ladder above.

2. **Manifest gate (AC5).** Shared — defined once at
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#manifest-gate-shared-by-sync-release-seed-and-audit`
   (base-ref pre-check → checkout-independent resolution → silent no-op on genuine absence). `audit`
   is its **fourth** consumer; not re-derived here. If **absent** → **silent no-op**: no scan, no
   dispatch, no PR, no error, **no stdout**, exit 0 — for **both** `audit` and `audit --dry-run`.

3. **Dispatch `knowledge-engineer` (audit) — single dispatch, no confirm gate.** Pass the run mode
   (`--dry-run` or default), the resolved activated-row set, and `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`. The dispatch
   performs the scan (§§20–22) and produces the findings report (§23).

4. **Scan + compute** (§§20–22): every activated row, partitioned by `generation-mode` into the
   deterministic-correction tier and the reference-integrity flag tier.

5. **Report / PR** (§23/§24):
   - **`--dry-run`** → print the report to stdout, open **no** PR, write nothing (AC3). Clean scan →
     `docs are in sync — no drift found`.
   - **default** → §24: ≥1 deterministic correction ⇒ write + embed report + open-or-update PR
     (only if `git status --porcelain` is non-empty); reference-integrity-flags-only ⇒ stdout report,
     no PR; clean ⇒ report clean, no PR.

Branch/PR mechanics (`docs/audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, the `Audit-Generated:` trailer, both re-run guards,
reset/force-push prohibition, the control-flow tail) live in §24 — not restated here.

## `distill ["<focus>"]` — special ADR route

`distill` is, like `seed adr`, a special route to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/adr-pipeline.md` — not
a generic docs mode. It takes an **optional positional focus** after the `distill` mode token
(`/sdlc:docs distill ["<focus>"]`); everything after the mode token is the focus text, identical to
the old `--distill "<focus>"` semantics. **Empty focus means "whole corpus" — not an error**; the
`seed adr` empty-pattern STOP does **not** apply here. There is no `--distill` flag form.

Dispatch the **ADR pipeline (distill)** with an explicit **ADR dispatch-type signal** — **no**
manifest gate. Runs the two-phase dispatch defined in `refs/adr-pipeline.md`: Phase 1 mines the
learnings corpus and returns candidate ADR(s), proposed `agents:` tags, and the per-candidate
deletion list; the founder-confirmation gate at this command layer presents them (drafts and
deletions together — nothing is deleted the founder did not see and approve); Phase 2 writes
confirmed ADRs (`status: accepted`), deletes founder-approved learnings in the same PR, and
regenerates `docs/adr/index.md`. The two-phase split, the gate flow, and the `docs(adr):` branch/PR
naming are handed to the agent per `refs/adr-pipeline.md`'s §3a command-layer-flow section, not
restated here.

## Release branch/PR naming

- Branch `docs/release-<VERSION>`; PR title `docs(docs): release <VERSION>`. Cut from the **base
  branch head** (`origin/<BASE-BRANCH>`), **not** a story branch — release aggregates work already
  merged to base.

Full contract (cut point, commit string + trailer, PR base, local-branch precondition, both re-run
guards — including the prohibition on `reset --hard` / force-push, a deliberate divergence from §7
— and the control-flow tail) is defined once in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#13-release-mode--branch--pr--control-flow` — this
command does not re-derive it.

## Seed branch/PR naming

Defined once in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md` §18. In summary: branch
`docs/seed-<type>-<SLUG>` (the **normalised** slug) cut from `origin/<BASE-BRANCH>` head — **not** a
story branch; commit and PR title `docs(docs): seed <type> <SLUG>`, carrying the trailer
`Seed-Generated: <type>/<SLUG>` that both re-run guards key on; PR base `<BASE-BRANCH>` from
project-context. `<type>` is in the branch name because two types may legitimately seed the same
topic. **The branch is never reset and never force-pushed** — a deliberate divergence from §7 (see
§18).

## Founder-confirm-gate authority note

Auto (deterministic) rows are written **un-gated** — they are computed in phase 1 and written in
phase 2 without a confirmation step, because they are fully derived and idempotent. Narrative
(how-to) drafts are written **only after explicit founder confirmation** at this command layer. A
dispatched subagent never runs the gate itself (it cannot pause for interactive input) — this
command owns it, exactly as it owns the gate for the `seed adr` and `distill` routes above.

## Branch/PR naming

- Branch `docs/sync-<STORY-KEY>`; PR title `docs(docs): sync <STORY-KEY>`. Both cut from the
  **story branch head**, not `<BASE-BRANCH>` — the deterministic regen must read the story
  branch's changed source.

Full contract (cut-point detail, commit string, PR base, re-run open-or-update behaviour, diff
source) is defined once in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#7-branch--pr-naming--control-flow` — this command does
not re-derive it.

## `llms.txt` format (v1 decision)

Index-only, grouped by Diátaxis quadrant, content matching the `llms-txt` row's `source-of-truth`
cell in `refs/doc-types.md` — see that cell rather than this restating it. Regenerated every run
(AC4), committed only if changed (AC6). Full format decision:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#8-llmstxt-format-v1-decision`.

## Command control flow

After the phase-2 PR is raised, drive the review loop to convergence exactly as the ADR pipeline's
command-layer flow does:

```bash
/loop /sdlc:loop <PR_URL>
```

If the harness cannot nest `/loop` from inside a command, fall back to `ScheduleWakeup` to drive
`sdlc:loop`'s pass-cycle instead (same effect — the loop is the last thing the session does), then
let its final pass release. If the command hit a terminal STOP, WARNING, or no-op before a PR was
raised, release the session directly via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/session-complete.sh` — for
exactly which pre-PR exit paths this covers, see the invoked mode's own control-flow tail:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#7-branch--pr-naming--control-flow` for `sync`,
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#13-release-mode--branch--pr--control-flow` for
`release`, or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/refs/docs-pipeline.md#18-seed-mode--branch--pr--control-flow`
for `seed` — each lists a different pre-PR exit set (`sync`'s WARNING/no-op pair is not `release`'s
or `seed`'s no-op/STOP set).

Match this row's scope **before** falling through to the generic table lookup: `seed adr`/`distill` never reach the manifest-gate check at all — they branch to the ADR pipeline earlier in the ladder, so there is no ordering ambiguity to resolve at runtime, only in how this table is read. |
